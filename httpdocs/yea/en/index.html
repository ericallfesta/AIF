		    	<h2>Creating New Value in an Era Where Individuals Are Connected Across "Borders"</h2>
		    	<p class="mt15">A gifted young man develops a technology that a person on the other side of the world decides to invest in – this is but one example of how in this new era, connections between people that transcend national borders can create new value.</p>
		    	<p class="mt15">People, products, money – rather than create organizations that merely encompass these elements, the key to competitiveness lies in the ability to combine human resources and capital from various parts of the world.  Innovation requires the interweaving of different elements.  While social networks help bring together individuals from different backgrounds with similar aspirations or thinking, in these uncertain times, it is more important than ever before to go one step further and nurture an environment where people of exceptional expertise and entrepreneurial spirit can realize their dreams.</p>
		    	<p class="mt15">We are striving to do just this, by creating a platform that brings together a diverse range of talent in Asia to spur innovation.  The Young Entrepreneur Award is a great part of this endeavor, and we encourage young people in Asia who have the venture spirit to be active on the world stage.</p>
		    	<p class="mt15">We urge you to take the challenge and look forward to your application!</p>

            	<img src="images/yea_photo.jpg" class="mb30" />
                <p>The Young Entrepreneur Award (YEA) is an international business plan competition for promising students from top universities in Asian countries.  Our vision is to create an Asian entrepreneurial platform that brings together Asia’s young entrepreneurs with investors to discover and produce technologies and content with high potential. </p>
				<p class="mt15">The 2nd YEA in 2013 received 143 entries from 20 countries/regions across Asia. Thirteen semi-finalists went through online presentations at the second round, and as a result, the selected 8 finalists were invited to the final round in Tokyo and made their excellent pitch in front of a large audience including prominent business leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors etc.</p>
				<p class="mt15">We are expecting an even wider coverage of participation from Asia for the 3rd YEA this year.  In addition to the stage of the final round, the finalists can also join one-week program for visiting leading companies, networking with business leaders at Asia Innovation Forum (AIF) 2015, and experiencing both traditional and modern culture of Japan with the Japanese university students.</p>
